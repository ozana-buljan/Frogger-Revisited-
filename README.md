# Udacity FEND- Project #4:  FROGGER (revisited)
My take on an oldschool Frogger arcade game. Project is done as a part of Udacity's FEND program.

DESKTOP ONLY!
Hope to make it work on mobile soon, though.

Hope you'll find it entertaining!



## Play!

### Demo

### The looks

## How to play?
 Goal is to collect as much points as you can!

### Getting points
* Each time frog reaches the water across the street without being struck by an enemy you get 10 points

* Each time frog collects a fly, player gets  10 points
* Each time frog collects a dragonfly, player gets 20 points
* Each time frog collects a butterfly, player gets  30 points
* Each time frog collects a heart, player gets  an extra life plus 5 points

### Moving around
Use UP DOWN LEFT RIGHT arrow keys on your keyboard to move around.

### Obstacles
Player should be wary of the obstacles! They shall not pass!

### Level UP
Player's progress is being tracked trough levels. The more more points they collect - heigher they go!

## Bugs
*   Responsiveness is iffy - as I'm still testing the game on as many devices and browswers as possible.


## To Do
* Make game looking good and working on phones!
* ENEMIES - > add different types of vechicles
* LEVELS -> add more complexity:
    -   cars go from both sides
    -   speed of cars increases with level
    -   add another row for each level

* Sound and music


## Contributing
If you'd like to play with my code - contribute or suggest how to improve it -I'd welcome any feedback!

I'd love to collaborate so any of the todos I'd gladly include. There are only two requirements I have to for the push request to be accepted:
- code improves game experience
- code is working!

Thank you in advance if you decide to tackle with this one!
